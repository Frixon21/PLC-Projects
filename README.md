# PLC Projects

This repository serves as a central index for my PLC and industrial automation projects.  
Each linked repository focuses on a specific control system scenario, with an emphasis on
ladder logic, safety interlocks, sequencing, and real-world automation patterns.

## Projects

### PLC Elevator Control System
Multi-floor elevator controller implemented in ladder logic, featuring:
- State-based motion control
- Mutual exclusion between up/down travel
- Floor request handling
- Safety interlocks and timed door logic
